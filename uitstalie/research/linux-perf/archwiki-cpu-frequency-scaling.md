CPU performance scaling enables the operating system to scale the CPU frequency up or down in order to save power or improve performance. Scaling can be done automatically in response to system load, adjust itself in response to ACPI events, or be manually changed by user space programs.

The Linux kernel offers CPU performance scaling via the CPUFreq subsystem, which defines two layers of abstraction:

- Scaling governors implement the algorithms to compute the desired CPU frequency, potentially based off of the system's needs.

- Scaling drivers interact with the CPU directly, enacting the desired frequencies that the current governor is requesting.

A default scaling driver and governor are selected automatically, but userspace tools like cpupower , acpid , Laptop Mode Tools , or GUI tools provided for your desktop environment, may still be used for advanced configuration.

## Userspace tools

### i7z

i7z AUR is an i7 (and now i3, i5, i7, i9) CPU reporting tool for Linux. It can be launched from a Terminal with the command i7z or as GUI with i7z-gui .

### turbostat

turbostat can display the frequency, power consumption, idle status and other statistics of the modern Intel and AMD CPUs.

### cpupower

cpupower is a set of userspace utilities designed to assist with CPU frequency scaling. The package is not required to use scaling, but is highly recommended because it provides useful command-line utilities and a systemd service to change the governor at boot.

The configuration file for cpupower is located in /etc/default/cpupower-service.conf . This configuration file is read by a bash script in /usr/lib/systemd/scripts/cpupower which is activated by systemd with cpupower.service . You may want to enable cpupower.service to start at boot.

### thermald

thermald is a Linux daemon used to prevent the overheating of Intel CPUs. This daemon proactively controls thermal parameters using P-states, T-states, and the Intel power clamp driver. thermald can also be used for older Intel CPUs. If the latest drivers are not available, then the daemon will revert to x86 model specific registers and the Linux "cpufreq subsystem" to control system cooling.

By default, it monitors CPU temperature using available CPU digital temperature sensors and maintains CPU temperature under control, before hardware takes aggressive correction action. If there is a skin temperature sensor in thermal sysfs, then it tries to keep skin temperature under 45C.

On Tiger Lake laptops (e.g. Dell Latitude 3420 ), this daemon has been reported as unlocking more performance than what would be otherwise available.

The associated systemd unit is thermald.service , which should be started and enabled . See thermald(8) for more information.

### power-profiles-daemon

The powerprofilesctl command-line tool from power-profiles-daemon handles power profiles (e.g. balanced, power-saver, performance) through the power-profiles-daemon service. GNOME and KDE also provide graphical interfaces for profile switching; see the following:

- GNOME#Power modes

- KDE#Power management

See the project's README for more information on usage, use cases, and comparisons with similar projects.

Start/enable the power-profiles-daemon service. Note that when powerprofilesctl is launched, it also attempts to start the service (see the unit status of dbus.service ).

Note

- power-profiles-daemon conflicts with other power management services such as TLP , tuned and system76-power AUR . To use one of the aforementioned services instead without uninstalling power-profiles-daemon (due to its potential status as a dependency), disable the power-profiles-daemon service by masking it (see also [1] , [2] ).

- tuned offers a tuned-ppd service compatibility layer for power-profiles-daemon since version 2.23.0.

- TLP also offers a complete compatibility replacement via the tlp-pd D-Bus API since version 1.9.

### tuned

tuned is a daemon for monitoring and adaptive tuning of system devices. It can configure GPU power modes, PCIe power management, set sysctl settings, adjust kernel scheduling and more; a daemon that also configures out aspects of power management in the system.

As of release 2.23.0 , the project ships with tuned-ppd , a compatibility layer for programs written for power-profiles-daemon , such as the following:

- GNOME#Power modes

- KDE#Power management

For reasons why tuned should be used instead of power-profiles-daemon, see Fedora's proposal to replace it with tuned. For opposite arguments, see [3] .

Start/enable the tuned daemon service. For power-profiles-daemon compatibility, also start/enable the tuned-ppd service. To control tuned from the command line, use tuned-adm to view and set profiles.

Note tuned-ppd is configured at /etc/tuned/ppd.conf . To set which tuned profile is used whenever a program selects a power-profiles-daemon profile, edit the file, which includes all the power-profiles-daemon modes and battery detection.

### cpupower-gui

cpupower-gui-git AUR is a graphical utility designed to assist with CPU frequency scaling. The GUI is based on GTK and is meant to provide the same options as cpupower . cpupower-gui can enable or disable cores and change the maximum/minimum CPU frequency and governor for each core. The application handles privilege granting through polkit and allows any logged-in user in the wheel user group to change the frequency and governor. See cpupower-gui systemd units for more information on cpupower-gui.service and cpupower-gui-user.service .

### gnome-shell-extension-cpupower

gnome-shell-extension-cpupower-git AUR is a GNOME shell extension that can alter minimum/maximum CPU frequencies and enable/disable frequency boosting.

### auto-cpufreq

auto-cpufreq AUR is an automatic CPU speed and power optimizer for Linux based on active monitoring of laptop's battery state, CPU usage, CPU temperature and system load.

### nvidia-powerd

The nvidia-powerd daemon provides support for NVIDIA 's Dynamic Boost technology on supported laptop platforms. It acts as a system-wide power controller that dynamically redistributes power between the GPU and CPU based on workload demands, while maintaining the system's total thermal budget. [4]

Start/enable the nvidia-powerd service, which is provided by the nvidia-utils package.

Note

- The prerequisites for nvidia-powerd are:

- NVIDIA Ampere or newer GPU.

- Intel Comet Lake or newer chipsets, or AMD Renoir or newer chipsets.

- Firmware-level Dynamic Boost support. This could be verified by checking the file /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus/ domain : bus : device . function /power

- Some devices require the "Performance mode" to be enabled in the BIOS/UEFI settings, or by specific key combinations (such as some Lenovo Legion laptops).

### s-tui

s-tui monitors CPU temperature, frequency, power and utilization from the terminal. CPU stress testing is also supported.

Note Some information, such as the reason for CPU throttling, is only displayed when s-tui is run with root privileges.

## Scaling drivers

Scaling drivers implement controls over frequency scaling by interfacing with the CPU hardware. The driver is the hardware interface that communicates with the governor which dictates policy for generic frequency control.

However intel_pstate and amd_pstate (active mode) implement their own internal control logic, sometimes bypassing traditional governors.

The ACPI 2.0 standard introduced power-performance states ("P-states") ), but can also have additional features (such as Hardware-based P-States, which allow the CPU to govern frequency autonomously). [5]

Note The kernel automatically selects the appropriate CPUFreq driver for the hardware at boot.

| scaling_driver
| Description

| acpi_cpufreq
| Utilizes ACPI power-performance states (P-States) . This driver also supports the Intel Enhanced SpeedStep (previously supported by the deprecated speedstep_centrino module). For AMD Ryzen, it only provides 3 frequency states.

| amd_pstate
| This driver has three modes corresponding to different degrees of autonomy from the CPU hardware: active, passive, and guided. Kernel 6.5 changed defaults to AMD P-State active (EPP) mode for supported Ryzen systems with CPPC support. However not all systems enable it automatically and server platforms may still default to acpi_cpufreq . See #amd_pstate for details.

| amd_pstate_epp
| EPP-based variant of the amd_pstate driver used in active mode.

| cppc_cpufreq
| Based on ACPI's newer CPPC system (see #Collaborative processor performance control ). Common default on AArch64 systems. Works on modern x86 too, but the intel_pstate and amd_pstate drivers implement additional hardware-specific features.

| intel_cpufreq
| Reported scaling_driver when intel_pstate is in "passive mode" [6] .

| intel_pstate
| Modern frequency scaling driver for Intel processors (Sandy Bridge and newer). It is used automatically for these processors instead of the other drivers below. This driver takes priority over other drivers and is built-in as opposed to being a module. By default, intel_pstate will select "Active Mode" if the processor supports hardware-managed P-States (HWP), called Speed Shift Technology (SST) by Intel (Skylake processors and newer). If the processor doesn't support HWP (or if using the intel_pstate=no_hwp parameter ) then intel_pstate will select "Passive Mode" and the reported scaling_driver string will be " intel_cpufreq ". If you encounter a problem while using this driver, you can revert to acpi_cpufreq scaling driver by adding intel_pstate=disable to your Kernel parameters . See the intel_pstate documentation for more details.

| p4_clockmod
| CPUFreq driver for Intel Pentium 4/Xeon/Celeron processors which lowers the CPU temperature by skipping clocks. (You probably want to use speedstep_lib instead, an internal helper library used by legacy Intel SpeedStep drivers.)

| pcc_cpufreq
| This driver supports Processor Clocking Control interface by Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft Corporation which is useful on some ProLiant servers.

| powernow_k8
| CPUFreq driver for K8/K10 Athlon 64/Opteron/Phenom processors. Since Linux 3.7, 'acpi_cpufreq' will automatically be used for more modern AMD CPUs.

| speedstep_lib
| CPUFreq driver for Intel SpeedStep-enabled processors (mostly Atoms and older Pentiums)

To see a full list of available modules, run:

```
$ ls /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/cpufreq/

To view drivers built-in to the current kernel, query its config:

```
$ zgrep -E 'CONFIG_X86_(INTEL_PSTATE|AMD_PSTATE|ACPI_CPUFREQ|PCC_CPUFREQ|POWERNOW_K8|P4_CLOCKMOD)=[y]' /proc/config.gz

Load the appropriate module (see Kernel modules for details). Once the appropriate cpufreq driver is loaded, detailed information about the CPU(s) can be displayed by running

```
$ cpupower frequency-info

### Setting maximum and minimum frequencies

In some cases, it may be necessary to manually set maximum and minimum frequencies.

To set the maximum clock frequency ( clock_freq is a clock frequency with units: GHz, MHz):

```
# cpupower frequency-set -u clock_freq

To set the minimum clock frequency:

```
# cpupower frequency-set -d clock_freq

To set the CPU to run at a specified frequency:

```
# cpupower frequency-set -f clock_freq

Note

- To adjust for only a single CPU core, append -c core_number .

- The governor, maximum and minimum frequencies can be set in /etc/default/cpupower .

Alternatively, you can set the frequency manually:

```
# echo value | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq

The available values can be found in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies or similar. [7]

### Configuring frequency boosting

Some processors support raising their frequency above the normal maximum for a short burst of time, under appropriate thermal conditions. On Intel processors, this is called Turbo Boost , and on AMD processors this is called Turbo-Core .

#### Setting via sysfs (intel_pstate)

intel_pstate has a driver-specific interface for prohibiting the processor from entering turbo P-States:

```
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo

#### Setting via sysfs (other scaling drivers)

For scaling drivers other than intel_pstate , if the driver supports boosting, the /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost attribute will be present, and can be used to disable/enable boosting.

To disable boosting, run:

```
# echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost

To enable boosting, run:

```
# echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/boost

#### Setting via x86_energy_perf_policy

On Intel processors, x86_energy_perf_policy can also be used to configure Turbo Boost:

```
# x86_energy_perf_policy --turbo-enable 0

### amd_pstate

amd_pstate has three operation modes: CPPC autonomous (active) mode, CPPC non-autonomous (passive) mode and CPPC guided autonomous (guided) mode. Officially supported kernels are built with CONFIG_X86_AMD_PSTATE_DEFAULT_MODE=3 which means the default for them is the active mode. This can be changed with the kernel parameter amd_pstate=active , amd_pstate=passive or amd_pstate=guided . To revert to the acpi_cpufreq driver, set amd_pstate=disable instead.

Active mode
The active mode is implemented by amd_pstate_epp (Energy Performance Preference) driver. In this mode, the amd_pstate_epp driver provides a hint to the hardware when software wants to bias the CPPC firmware towards performance (0x0) or power efficiency (0xff).
Passive mode
The passive mode is implemented by the amd_pstate driver. In this mode, the driver defines a desired performance based on the current workload, and specifically how much performance degradation can be tolerated without affecting quality of life.
Guided mode
The guided mode is implemented by the amd_pstate driver. In this mode, the amd_pstate driver requests minimum and maximum performance level and the platform autonomously selects a performance level in this range and appropriate to the current workload.
Note Some motherboards might not enable the required setting in their firmware, leading to a the _CPC object is not present in SBIOS or ACPI disabled error. Change Enable CPPC , usually found in the AMD CBS > NBIO > SMU > CPPC , from Auto to Enabled , or any similar settings in your UEFI. If they are not present, consult the vendor website for an update, or check if the motherboard has a hidden way to show advanced UEFI options.

## Scaling governors

Scaling governors are power schemes determining the desired frequency for the CPU. Some request a constant frequency, others implement algorithms to dynamically adjust according to the system load. The governors included in the kernel are:

Note Each governor is compatible with any scaling driver, with the exceptions of intel_pstate and amd_pstate in active mode, which provide pseudo-governors in the form of powersave and performance . See #Autonomous frequency scaling below.

| Governor
| Description

| performance
| Run the CPU at the maximum frequency, obtained from /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu X /cpufreq/scaling_max_freq .

| powersave
| Run the CPU at the minimum frequency, obtained from /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu X /cpufreq/scaling_min_freq .

| userspace
| Run the CPU at user specified frequencies, configurable via /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu X /cpufreq/scaling_setspeed .

| ondemand
| Scales the frequency dynamically according to current load. Jumps to the highest frequency and then possibly back off as the idle time increases.

| conservative
| Scales the frequency dynamically according to current load. Scales the frequency more gradually than ondemand.

| schedutil
| Scheduler-driven CPU frequency selection [8] , [9] .

Depending on the scaling driver, one of these governors will be loaded by default:

- schedutil since Linux 4.9.5

- the internal powersave governor for Intel and AMD CPUs using the intel_pstate and amd_pstate driver respectively (see the note above, it is equivalent to schedutil ).

Warning Use CPU monitoring tools (for temperatures, voltage, etc.) when changing the default governor.

To activate a particular governor, run:

```
# cpupower frequency-set -g governor

Note

- To adjust for only a single CPU core, append -c core_number to the command above.

- Activating a governor requires that specific kernel module (named cpufreq_ governor ) is loaded. As of kernel 3.4, these modules are loaded automatically.

Alternatively, you can activate a governor on every available CPU manually:

```
# echo governor | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

Tip To monitor cpu speed in real time, run:

```
$ watch cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]*/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq

### Tuning the ondemand governor

See the kernel documentation for details.

#### Switching threshold

To set the threshold for stepping up to another frequency:

```
# echo -n percent > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ governor /up_threshold

To set the threshold for stepping down to another frequency:

```
# echo -n percent > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ governor /down_threshold

#### Sampling rate

The sampling rate determines how frequently the governor checks to tune the CPU. sampling_down_factor is a tunable that multiplies the sampling rate when the CPU is at its highest clock frequency, thereby delaying load evaluation and improving performance. Allowed values for sampling_down_factor are 1 to 100000. This tunable has no effect on behavior at lower CPU frequencies/loads.

To read the value (default = 1), run:

```
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/sampling_down_factor

To set the value, run:

```
# echo -n value > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/sampling_down_factor

#### Make changes permanent

Since Linux 5.9, it is possible to set the cpufreq.default_governor kernel option. [10] To set the desired scaling parameters at boot, configure the cpupower utility and enable its systemd service. Alternatively, systemd-tmpfiles or udev rules can be used.

## Autonomous frequency scaling

Both Intel and AMD define a way to have the CPU decide its own speed based on (1) a performance range from the system and (2) a performance/power hint specifying the preference. The fully-autonomous mode is activated when:

- amd_pstate is set to "active"—requires CPPC support in both the CPU and BIOS,

- intel_pstate is set to "active" and hardware P-state (HWP) is available (i.e. Sandy Bridge and newer)—works out-of-the-box.

The most important feature of active governing is that only two governors appear available, powersave and performance . They do not work at all like their normal counterpart, however: these levels are translated into an Energy Performance Preference hint for the CPU's internal governor. As a result, they both provide dynamic scaling, similar to the schedutil or ondemand generic governors respectively, differing mostly in latency. The performance algorithm should give better power saving functionality than the old ondemand governor for Intel HWP.

### Intel active, non-HWP

The intel-pstate driver has, confusingly, an "active" mode that works without the CPU's active decision. This mode turns on when kernel cmdline forces an "active" mode but HWP is unavailable or disabled. It will still only provide powersave and performance , but the driver itself does the governing in a way similar to schedutil and performance (i.e. it stays at the maximum P-state). There is no real benefit to this mode compared to passive intel-pstate.

### Setting the EPP

It is possible to select in-between hints with the sysfs interfaces available. The interface is identical between AMD and Intel, where the files /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/energy_performance_preference describe the current preference and /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/energy_performance_available_preferences providing a list of available preferences. One can also pass a number between 0 (favor performance) and 255 (favor power). A fallback implementation is provided for Intel CPUs without EPP, translating strings to EPB levels (described in next section) but failing on numbers.

x86_energy_perf_policy supports configuration of EPP hints via the --hwp-epp switch on Intel CPUs only . It works via direct access of machine-specific registers (MSRs) which differ between Intel and AMD. The program can also restrict the range of HWP frequencies using a range of frequency multipliers.

To enable hardware P-States with x86_energy_perf_policy(8) :

```
# x86_energy_perf_policy -H 1
# x86_energy_perf_policy -U 1

## Collaborative processor performance control

The power consumption of modern CPUs is no longer simply dependent on the frequency or voltage setting, as there are modules that can be switched on as needed. Collaborative processor performance control (CPPC) is the P-state replacement provided by ACPI 5.0. Instead of defining a table of static frequency levels, the processor provides many abstract performance levels and the operating system selects from these levels. There are two advantages:

- There is no longer a limit of 16 P-state entries; a typical CPU provides hundreds of levels to choose from.

- The CPU can provide a higher frequency (e.g. boost) for a performance level when certain parts (e.g. vector FPU) is not used.

On the other hand, the flexible frequency breaks frequency-invariant utilization tracking, which is important for fast frequency changes by schedutil . A number of vendor-specific methods have been used to make the frequency static under CPPC, with most successes coming from arm64.

cppc_cpufreq is the generic CPPC scaling driver. amd_pstate also uses ACPI CPPC to manage the CPU frequency when the Zen 3 MSR is unavailable – this method, also called "shared memory", has higher latency than MSR.

## Intel performance and energy bias hint

The Intel performance and energy bias hint (EPB) is an interface provided by Intel CPUs to allow for user space to specify the desired power-performance tradeoff, on a scale of 0 (highest performance) to 15 (highest energy savings). The EPB register is another layer of performance management functioning independently from frequency scaling. It influences how aggressive P-state and C-state selection will be, and informs internal model-specific decision making that affects energy consumption.

Common values and their aliases, as recognized by sysfs and x86_energy_perf_policy(8) are:

| EPB value

| String

| 0

| performance

| 4

| balance-performance

| 6

| normal, default

| 8

| balance-power

| 15

| power

### Setting via sysfs

The EPB can be set using a sysfs attribute:

```
# echo epb | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/power/energy_perf_bias

### Setting via x86_energy_perf_policy

With x86_energy_perf_policy :

```
# x86_energy_perf_policy --epb epb

### Setting via cpupower

With cpupower :

```
# cpupower set -b epb_value

Warning cpupower does not support the string aliases. If given a string, it will silently set the EPB to 0, corresponding to max performance.

## Interaction with ACPI events

Users may configure scaling governors to switch automatically based on different ACPI events such as connecting the AC adapter or closing a laptop lid. A quick example is given below; however, it may be worth reading full article on acpid .

Events are defined in /etc/acpi/handler.sh . If the acpid package is installed, the file should already exist and be executable. For example, to change the scaling governor from performance to conservative when the AC adapter is disconnected and change it back if reconnected:

```
/etc/acpi/handler.sh

```
[...]

ac_adapter)
case "$2" in
AC*)
case "$4" in
00000000)
echo "conservative" >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
echo -n $minspeed >$setspeed
#/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode start
;;
00000001)
echo "performance" >/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
echo -n $maxspeed >$setspeed
#/etc/laptop-mode/laptop-mode stop
;;
esac
;;
*) logger "ACPI action undefined: $2" ;;
esac
;;

[...]

## Troubleshooting

### BIOS frequency limitation

Some CPU and BIOS configurations are unable to reach their maximum frequency or scale to higher frequencies at all. This is most likely caused by BIOS events telling the OS to limit the frequency resulting in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/bios_limit set to a lower value.

Before blaming the BIOS implementation, verify you have not manually set the CPU frequency limits, thermal management preferences, or other relevant options in the BIOS Setup Utility.

On some devices (e.g. IBM/Lenovo Thinkpads), usage with a failing battery (or it removed) coupled with an undersized AC adapter may trigger a BIOS-enforced CPU frequency limit. See ThinkWiki .

Warning

- CPU frequency limitation is a safety feature of your BIOS and should not need to be bypassed in most cases.

- This can seriously damage your hardware: use at your own risk. [11]

You can tell the kernel to ignore the limitations: set the processor.ignore_ppc=1 kernel parameter . For trying this temporarily, change the value in /sys/module/processor/parameters/ignore_ppc from 0 to 1 .

Some systems use a different mechanism to limit the CPU frequency when running without battery or an unofficial power adapter. On Intel CPUs, you can manipulate the BD PROCHOT bit in Intel CPUs as explained in Lenovo ThinkPad T480#CPU stuck at minimum frequency and Dell XPS 15 (9560)#General slowness & stuttering . These steps may also apply to other devices, like Intel-based MacBooks running at the minimum CPU frequency without a battery.
